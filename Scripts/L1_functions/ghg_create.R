# Title: GHG L1 generation (QA/QC) script
# By: Adrienne Breef-Pilz
# Written: 24 Nov 23, 
# Last updated: 
# 20 Jun 24 (ABP)- read in multiple air pressure files
# 24 Sep 24- round numeric columns to 4 digits
# 22 Oct 24- added in option for a historical file for obs from 2015-2022
# 02 Jan 25- Changed how MDLs are calculated. Only take the previous 2 years for the observation year.
# added in a saved data frame of observations that had notes from the Analytical Lab. 
# 12 Jan 25 - Added in a section to select samples that had re run and flag them
# 18 Feb 25 - Added a if statement when no new files for the year then the function stops
# 28 Feb 25 - Added code to look for all GHG files in the ALC folder on Google
# 01 Apr 25 - Added code to authenticate GoogleDrive

# Additional notes: This script is included with this EDI package to show which QAQC has already
# been applied to generate these data along with the ghg_functions_for_L1.R which are used here.
# This script is only for internal use by the data creator team and is provided as a reference; it will not run as-is. 

# This function:
# 1. Read in the Maintenance Log and then Raw files 
# 2. Process the files if necessary
# 3. Make Flag Columns and add flags for missing values and negative values 
# 4. Take out values based on the Maintenance Log
# 5. Additional Maintenance
# 6. Save files

# The MDL file is generated from the Analytical chem lab. Make sure you have the right link if the function fails. 
# You need the one that is the reference tank


# Download/load libraries
